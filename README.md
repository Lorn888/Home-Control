# Lighting Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes lighting data collected from my room using HomeBridge on a Raspberry Pi. The system controls the lighting and generates log files that capture the operational status of the devices. The goal is to provide insights into device performance, including brightness levels, state (on/off), and timestamps, enabling better understanding and control of lighting in the space.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts in Power BI display device states over time, allowing users to track when devices were active or inactive.
- **Historical Analysis**: Users can analyze historical data to observe trends in brightness levels and device usage patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The project features an intuitive interface for easy navigation and exploration of data insights.

## Technologies Used

- **HomeBridge**: Used on a Raspberry Pi to control lighting devices and generate logs.
- **Raspberry Pi**: The platform for running the HomeBridge service and executing scripts.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store the log files generated by HomeBridge securely.
- **Azure Functions**: To trigger the transformation of log files into a manageable CSV format and import the data into a database.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **DAX**: Used for data calculations and creating measures in Power BI for analyzing device states.
- **SQL Database**: To store processed data for efficient querying and visualization.

## Process

1. **Data Collection**: HomeBridge on the Raspberry Pi controls the lighting and generates log files that track brightness levels and state changes.
2. **Log Processing**: A custom script on the Raspberry Pi sends these logs to Azure Blob Storage.
3. **Data Transformation**: Azure Functions are triggered to convert the log files into a more manageable CSV format and import this data into a SQL database.
4. **Data Visualization**: The processed data from the SQL database is used in Power BI to create interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore and analyze device performance over time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of modern technologies to transform raw lighting data into meaningful insights through visualization and analysis. By leveraging HomeBridge, Azure services, and Power BI, it showcases how automation can enhance home lighting control and monitoring.
